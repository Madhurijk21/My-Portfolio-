<h1>Projects</h1>

<p class="lead">
    Below are some of the projects I've worked on, demonstrating my skills in backend development, machine learning, and data analysis:
</p>

<h3>1. <strong>Short-Term Wind Speed Forecasting (EEMD + LSTM)</strong></h3>
<p>
    This project focused on forecasting wind speed using a combination of **Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks.
    - **Tools/Technologies Used**: Python, Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy.
    - **Description**: Designed and implemented an LSTM model after performing feature engineering and time series analysis. Optimized the model for accuracy and deployed it for real-time forecasting.
</p>

<h3><strong>2. Breast Cancer Prediction (Machine Learning & Statistical Modeling)</strong></h3>

        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>3.  <strong>Energy Monitoring System (Backend Development)</strong></h3>
<p>
    Led the development of an energy monitoring system as part of a team at Infosys, enabling real-time monitoring of energy consumption in buildings.
    - **Tools/Technologies Used**: C#, ASP.NET Core, SQL Server, Entity Framework.
    - **Description**: Developed backend services to capture and process data, created APIs for frontend integration, and optimized database queries for real-time monitoring.
</p>

<h3>4. <strong>OnlineFoodOrder (Capstone Project - Backend Development)</strong></h3>
<p>
    A full-stack application for managing online food orders, with a focus on backend logic and database management.
    - **Tools/Technologies Used**: C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, SQL Server.
    - **Description**: Designed and implemented the backend for managing orders, payments, and customer details. Integrated third-party APIs for real-time order tracking.
</p>
